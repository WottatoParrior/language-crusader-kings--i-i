# Crusader Kings II modding language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting to CK2 config files in Atom.

This grammar is in an early stage and only supports the on_actions.txt and event files.

Contributions are greatly appreciated.

Special thanks to the contributers to the (Atom C/C++ grammar)(https://github.com/atom/language-c) contributors since most of the code is based off of their work.
